# plot_route_app
A streamlit based web app to plot geospatial routes on a map from input data of random places in SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil. Works for any dataset with columns named "Rota" (Route), "Lat" (latitude) and "Long" (longitude). 

Deployed at: https://share.streamlit.io/marcos-mansur/plot_route_app/main/MyApp.py


Planned improvements:
  - Make so the routes can have string for name
  - add a input text box so people can input the routes adresses
  - connect with google maps api to fetch more coordinate points of the actual street route so the plotted routes look more real
